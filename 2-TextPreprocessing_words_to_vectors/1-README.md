# Bag of Words Model (BoW) - README

## Overview

This notebook implements the **Bag of Words (BoW)** model for text processing. The BoW model is a commonly used method in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to represent text data as numerical vectors. It involves creating a vocabulary of all unique words in the corpus and then representing each document by counting the occurrences of each word in the document.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Tokenization**: 
   - The text is split into individual words or tokens.
   
2. **Vocabulary Creation**:
   - A dictionary of all unique words in the corpus is created. Each word in the vocabulary has a unique index.
   
3. **Word Count Vectors**:
   - For each document, a vector is created where each element represents the frequency of the corresponding word from the vocabulary in the document.

### Steps in the Notebook:
1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, lowercasing, and removing stop words or special characters to clean the text.
   
2. **BoW Representation**:
   - Create a vocabulary and generate word count vectors for each document.
   
3. **Visualization**:
   - Basic data exploration is done to visualize the distribution of words in the corpus.

### When to Use the Bag of Words Model:

- **Simple Document Classification Tasks**: BoW works well for simple text classification problems such as spam detection or sentiment analysis.
- **Text Similarity**: It's useful when determining how similar or different two texts are by comparing their word counts.
- **When Context Isn't Important**: Since BoW ignores word order and structure, itâ€™s best used when word context is less important, like keyword-based document search.

### Limitations:
- **Ignores Word Order**: BoW treats all words independently and does not capture relationships between words (no context or semantics).
- **Sparse Representation**: Large vocabularies lead to high-dimensional sparse matrices, which can be computationally expensive and harder to interpret.
- **Inability to Capture Importance**: All words are treated equally, even though some may be more important in conveying the meaning of the text.

This method is simple yet powerful for many basic NLP tasks, and it is often used as a baseline for more advanced methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
